# Note of Web Scraping and NLP


## What is Web Scraping and crawling

Web scraping is a practice of gathering through any means other than a program interacting with an API. This is most commonly accomplished by writing an automated program that queries a web server, requests data and then parse that data to extract needed information.


## Why Web Scraping?

Web scrapers are excellent at gathering and processing large amounts of data among other things. You can find an API for many different types of data you might want to use such as Twitter posts or Wikipedia pages. In general, it is preferable to use an API(if one exits), rather than build a bot to get the same data.


In theory, if you can view it in your browser, you can access it via a Python script. If you can access it in a script, you can store it in a database. If you can store it in a database, you can do virtually anything with that data.

## The Legalities and Ethics of Web Scraping

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) outlines some rules for automated handling of copyrighted materials:

* You should not directly publish copyrighted material without permission from the original author or copyright holder
* It is fine to store copyrighted materials that you have free access to in your own nonpublic database for the purpose of analysis
* It is not fine to publish that database to your website for viewing or download
* It is fine to publish the statistics analysis results from the copyrighted materials


## Turn data into decisions
Companies are betting on data-driven insight, seizing opportunities that are emerging from the convergence of four powerful trends:

* New methods of collecting, managing, and analyzing data
* Cloud computing that offers inexpensive storage and flexible, on-demand computing power for massive data sets
* Visualization techiniques that turn complex data into images that tell a compelling story
* Tools that make the power of data available to anyone
